          You’ll come to Siem Reap for Angkor Wat, which is breathtaking, but the city is a nice little bonus. Charming and walkable there’s plenty of delicious food choices and places for a drink. It can get pretty rowdy in parts, but overall it’s a great value ($.50 beers!) and much more pleasant than I expected.
